## 👩‍💻 About Me
I am a developer in training, interested in creating simple, functional, and well-structured solutions.  
I enjoy learning by doing, testing ideas, and improving a little every day.

When I’m not coding, I like listening to music, reading, and exploring content that stimulates creativity and critical thinking.  
This GitHub brings together my projects, studies, and experiments throughout my journey in technology.
